Event Store Promises using MySQL and RabbitMQ
=============================================

Aiming to be a drop in replacement (or pre-placement, for careful sysops not wanting to add
[Event Store](https://geteventstore.com/) to the stack yet) of
[event-store-promise](https://github.com/Textalk/event-store-promise).  It should keep true to the
exact same API.
