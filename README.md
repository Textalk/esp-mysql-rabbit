Event Store Promises using MySQL and RabbitMQ
=============================================

Aiming to be a drop in replacement (or pre-placement, for careful sysops not wanting to add
[Event Store](https://geteventstore.com/) to the stack yet) of
[event-store-promise](https://github.com/Textalk/event-store-promise).  It should keep true to the
exact same API.


Using it in your project
------------------------

Install:

```bash
npm install --save @textalk/esp-mysql-rabbit
cat db.sql | mysql -uesp -pesp -Desp
```

Connect:

```
EventStorePromise(
  {
    mysql: {
      user:     'esp',
      password: 'esp',
      database: 'esp',
    },
    amqp: {
      url:      'amqp://localhost',
      exchange: 'events',
    }
  },
  {timeout: 10000}
).then(esp => {
  // Use itâ€¦
})
```

MySQL: For transactions to work optimally, the database should NOT have `READ COMMITTED`.

AMQP: The exchange will be asserted as a durable `topic`-exchange.

See `examples/readWriting.js` for a working example (provided mysql and amqp-servers are in
expected place).


API
---

The same as [event-store-promise](https://github.com/Textalk/event-store-promise).


### Known differences / gotchas

**esp.writeEvents()** will throw error if the events can't be written to MySQL, but will not throw
on AMQP problems, since the events are already written at that point.

**esp.writeEvents()** is not fully idempotent - if you try to write the same event on the same
eventNumber, it WILL throw an error.
